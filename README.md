# Lending Club Portfolio Optimization

##Goal
Lending Club is an online peer-to-peer lending platform, matching borrowers and lenders. Since its foundation in 2006, Lending Club has issued over $22Bn in loans to individuals and small businesses. As an investor, you can choose which loans to finance, and whether to finance as little as $25 or the full loan. Each investor is trying to build the best portfolio of loans. Our project utilizes Artificial Intelligence techniques in order to try and build the optimal portfolio of Lending Club loans. In particular, our algorithms try to build the optimal portfolio from loans offered by Lending Club in any given month.
